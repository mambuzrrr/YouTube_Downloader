---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Download or clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mambuzrrr/YouTube_Downloader.git
cd YouTube_Downloader
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The ```requirements.txt``` includes:
```bash
yt-dlp
PyQt6
qdarkstyle
```
### 3. Install FFmpeg (Audio Converter)

FFmpeg is essential for converting YouTube audio streams into MP3 files. The program calls FFmpeg internally during the download process.
#### Windows Users: Recommended Installation via Batch Script
We provide a convenient batch script setup_ffmpeg.bat that will:

 - Download the latest FFmpeg full build archive (7z format) from a trusted source

 - Extract FFmpeg to ```C:\ffmpeg```

 - Add FFmpeg's ```bin``` directory to your system PATH environment variable automatically

#### How to use the batch script:

1. Install 7-Zip if not already installed, from https://www.7-zip.org/
The script expects 7-Zip's command line tool (```7z.exe```) at ```C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe```.
If you installed 7-Zip elsewhere, edit ```setup_ffmpeg.bat``` and update the path accordingly.

2. Run ```setup_ffmpeg.bat``` by double-clicking it or running it in a Command Prompt with administrator rights.

3. After the script finishes, restart your computer or open a new Command Prompt window to ensure the updated PATH variable is loaded.

4. Verify FFmpeg installation by running:
```bash 
ffmpeg -version
```
You should see FFmpeg version info printed.
#### Alternative FFmpeg Installation
If you prefer manual installation, download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add the ```bin``` folder to your system PATH manually.

## How to Use the Downloader
Run the application:
```bash
python YT-DL.py
```
- The GUI will open. Paste a YouTube video or playlist URL into the text field.
- Select the output folder where MP3 files should be saved. Default is your current working directory.
- Choose your preferred MP3 bitrate quality from the dropdown (128 to 320 kbps).
- If downloading a playlist, check the Download playlist checkbox.
- Click Start Download to begin.
- Watch real-time status updates and logs in the output window.
- You can stop the download at any time with the Stop button.
- Switch the interface language between English and German using the dropdown at the top right.

--- 

## Important Notes

- Currently, this downloader only supports audio-only MP3 downloads.
- Video downloads (e.g., MP4) are not supported yet but may be added in future versions.
- FFmpeg must be installed and accessible via your system PATH for audio extraction to work.
- The downloader uses yt-dlp internally, which supports a wide variety of YouTube URLs and playlist formats.
- If you experience errors related to FFmpeg, double-check your FFmpeg installation and PATH variable.

---

## Troubleshooting
Error: ```'ffmpeg' not found```
This means FFmpeg is either not installed or not in your system PATH.
Run the batch installer or manually install and add FFmpeg to PATH.

#### Download fails or hangs
 - Check your internet connection.
 - Verify that the URL is correct and publicly accessible.

#### No audio output or corrupted files
 - Verify FFmpeg is functioning correctly by running ```ffmpeg -version``` in a terminal.

#### Permissions issues saving files
 - Ensure you have write permissions to the output folder you selected.

## Changelog

**Whats new / improved**
- **Format selection (MP3 / MP4)**  
  - Added a dropdown to choose output format (MP3 = audio-only, MP4 = merged video+audio).
  - MP3 uses FFmpeg postprocessor to extract audio.  
  - MP4 downloads best video + best audio and merges into `.mp4`.

- **Open output folder button**  
  - New button to open the chosen output directory.

- **Title prefetch & improved status messages**  
  - Tries to fetch video/playlist info before download and shows loaded title (playlist name + item count where applicable).
  - Progress messages include more useful details (title, percent, speed, ETA).

- **Better threading & error handling**  
  - Downloads run in a separate `QThread` and stop/cleanup logic is improved.
  - Errors are logged and shown in message dialogs.

- **Small UX improvements**  
  - Log is cleared at start of a new download - status label shows concise context info.
  - Language text lookups include safe fallbacks to avoid crashes when entries are missing.

**Notes**
- FFmpeg is still required for MP3 extraction and for merging MP4. Ensure `ffmpeg` is on PATH.
